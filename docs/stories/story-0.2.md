# Story 0.2: Core API Server & Health Endpoint

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a basic, runnable FastAPI server with a health check endpoint,
**so that** I can confirm the application is running and deployable.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A `main.py` file is created inside the `src/ordo` directory.
2. FastAPI and Uvicorn are added as main project dependencies in `pyproject.toml`.
3. The `main.py` file contains a basic FastAPI application instance.
4. A GET endpoint is created at `/health`.
5. When called, the `/health` endpoint returns an HTTP 200 OK status and a JSON response of `{"status": "ok"}`.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Add `fastapi` and `uvicorn` to dependencies using `poetry add`.
- [x] Create the `src/ordo/main.py` file.
- [x] Implement the FastAPI app and the `/health` endpoint within `main.py`.
- [x] Add a run command to `pyproject.toml` scripts for `uvicorn ordo.main:app`.

## Dev Notes
This story builds on the scaffolding from Story 0.1. It introduces the core web framework and provides a simple way to verify that the application can be started.

- **Framework:** FastAPI is the chosen web framework (Architecture, Section 3).
- **Runtime:** Uvicorn will serve the application (Architecture, Section 3).
- **Source Tree:** The `main.py` file should be placed in `src/ordo/` as specified in the architecture (Section 9.1).

### Testing
- No formal automated tests are required for this story.
- Verification will be done by running the server and making a `curl` request to the `/health` endpoint to check the response.

## File List
- `pyproject.toml`
- `src/ordo/main.py`
