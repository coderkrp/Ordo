# Story 0.3: Initial Project Documentation

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** new user,
**I want** a clear README and Quickstart guide,
**so that** I can understand the project and run it quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A `README.md` file is created at the project root.
2. The README contains a project description, a list of features, and a link to the Quickstart guide.
3. A `docs/quickstart.md` guide is created.
4. The Quickstart guide provides step-by-step instructions to configure and run the application using Docker.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create `README.md` with core project information.
- [x] Create `docs/quickstart.md`.
- [x] Write instructions for setting up the `.env` file for configuration.
- [x] Write `docker-compose up` command and verification steps.

## Dev Notes
This documentation is critical for user adoption. It should be clear, concise, and accurate. It will need to be updated as new features (like the OTP helper script) are added in later epics.

### Testing
- Verification will be done by a human following the Quickstart guide to ensure it works as described.

## File List
- `README.md`
- `docs/quickstart.md`
