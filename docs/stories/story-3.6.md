# Story 3.6: Contribution Guide & Adapter SDK

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** contributor,
**I want** clear docs and SDK examples,
**so that** I can add new brokers easily.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is created at the root of the project.
2. The guide explains the adapter architecture and the process for adding a new broker.
3. It includes a small "Adapter SDK" section with code snippets for the `IBrokerAdapter` interface.
4. It outlines the requirements for unit tests and documentation for new adapters.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Write the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
- [ ] Document the `IBrokerAdapter` interface and its methods.
- [ ] Provide a step-by-step guide for creating a new adapter file, running tests, and submitting a pull request.

## Dev Notes
- **Open Source:** This is critical for growing the project and achieving the goal of becoming the go-to foundation for Indian market integrations (NFR16, NFR18).

### Testing
- Verification will be done by having a team member follow the guide to create a simple mock adapter.
