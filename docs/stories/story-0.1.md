# Story 0.1: Project Scaffolding

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a standardized project structure with git, dependency management, and linting configured,
**so that** I can start developing in a clean and consistent environment.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A new Git repository is initialized.
2. A `pyproject.toml` file is created and configured for Poetry.
3. `black` and `ruff` are added as development dependencies.
4. A basic `src/ordo` directory structure is created.
5. A `.gitignore` file is created with standard Python and environment-specific ignores.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Initialize Git repository.

## File List
- .git/
- pyproject.toml
- poetry.lock
- src/ordo/
- .gitignore

## Dev Notes
This is the foundational story for the entire project. The goal is to create a clean, repeatable setup.

- **Tooling:** As per the architecture document (Section 3 & 12.1), this project will use Poetry for dependency management, `ruff` for linting, and `black` for formatting.
- **Source Tree:** The architecture document (Section 9.1) specifies the refined source tree. This story creates the initial `src/ordo` part of that structure.

### Testing
- No specific application tests are required for this story.
- Verification will be done by checking for the existence and content of the created files (`pyproject.toml`, `.gitignore`) and the directory structure.

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Overall, the implementation quality for this foundational story is excellent. The developer has meticulously followed the project's established conventions for scaffolding, dependency management, and initial directory structure. The use of standard tools like Poetry, Black, and Ruff ensures consistency and maintainability from the outset.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed as the story involved only initial project setup and no functional code.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ (Adherence to Poetry, Black, Ruff for dependency management, formatting, and linting)
- Project Structure: ✓ (Correct `src/ordo` structure and `.github` placement)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (Story explicitly states no application tests required, verification was manual as per plan)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (All 5 Acceptance Criteria have been fully implemented and verified)

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] All tasks completed as per story definition.

### Security Review

No security concerns identified as this story focuses purely on project scaffolding and does not involve any functional code or sensitive data handling.
