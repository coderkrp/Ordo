# Story 1.3a: Session Manager Implementation

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** a secure `SessionManager` component,
**so that** I can persist and retrieve session tokens for broker adapters without key collisions.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. A `SessionManager` class is created.
2. It provides methods to securely store (`set_session`) and retrieve (`get_session`) session data.
3. The storage mechanism MUST prevent key collisions between different broker adapters (e.g., by namespacing keys per broker).
4. Session data is encrypted at rest.
5. The implementation is generic enough to be used by any broker adapter.
6. Unit tests are created to verify the namespacing and functionality.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create `src/ordo/security/session.py`.
- [x] Implement the `SessionManager` class with `set_session` and `get_session` methods.
- [x] Implement a key namespacing strategy within the `SessionManager`.
- [x] Choose and implement an encryption/decryption strategy for session data.
- [x] Create `tests/security/test_session.py` with unit tests for the `SessionManager`, including namespacing.

## Dev Notes
- **Security:** This component is critical for security (NFR9). The encryption must be strong, and keys must be managed securely via the application configuration.
- **Dependencies:** This story unblocks Story 1.3b (Fyers Authentication).

## Dev Agent Record
**File List:**
- `src/ordo/security/session.py`
- `tests/security/test_session.py`

**Completion Notes:**
- Implemented `SessionManager` with Fernet encryption.
- Added namespacing to prevent key collisions.
- Wrote comprehensive unit tests.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation of the `SessionManager` is clean, correct, and adheres to the project's coding standards. The use of Fernet for encryption is appropriate, and the namespacing strategy effectively prevents key collisions. The code is well-documented and easy to understand.

### Refactoring Performed

None required. The code is of high quality.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓]
- Project Structure: [✓]
- Testing Strategy: [✓]
- All ACs Met: [✓]

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] All required improvements are already handled.

### Security Review

The implementation correctly uses encryption and handles the secret key securely through the application settings. No security vulnerabilities were found.

### Performance Considerations

For the expected scale of this application, the in-memory session storage is acceptable. If the number of sessions grows significantly, a more scalable solution like Redis might be considered in the future.

### Files Modified During Review

None.

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.3a-session-manager-implementation.yml
